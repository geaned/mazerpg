## Heroes of Dungeons a.k.a. mazerpg
A text-based RPG with pseudographics I was working on while studying at high school. *Who knows, perhaps I will rework it when I have some spare time.*

Required OS: Windows 7 or later (there is a low chance of encountering localization bugs on newer versions of Windows)

Language: Russian

Libraries used: SFML 2.5.1

The `mazerpg.exe` will not launch if the `music` folder and `openal32.dll` file are not present in the same directory. You can use the `main.cpp` file to build the project yourself (requires SFML).
